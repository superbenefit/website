# Technical Specification: SuperBenefit DAO Homepage

**Version 1.0 | January 2025**

---

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This specification defines the requirements and architecture for implementing a new homepage for SuperBenefit DAO. The homepage will serve as the primary entry point to the organization's digital ecosystem, replacing the current Notion-based site with a modern, performant, markdown-driven static site. The implementation prioritizes rapid deployment, maintainability by a small team, and visual consistency with existing SuperBenefit properties while establishing a foundation for iterative enhancement.

### 1.2 Goals and Success Criteria

The homepage must achieve three primary goals. First, it must present SuperBenefit DAO professionally to external audiences, clearly communicating the organization's purpose, values, and offerings. Second, it must aggregate and surface relevant content from the organization's distributed repositories without requiring manual synchronization. Third, it must establish patterns and infrastructure that enable future expansion without architectural rewrites.

Success will be measured against specific criteria. The site must achieve Lighthouse performance scores of 95 or higher across all metrics. The codebase must be comprehensible to developers with basic JavaScript experience, requiring no more than two days of onboarding for new contributors. The monthly operational cost must not exceed the free tier limits of Cloudflare Workers.

### 1.3 Scope and Boundaries

This specification covers the initial homepage implementation and foundational architecture. The scope includes the homepage itself with hero content and key messaging, automatic aggregation of content from external repositories, navigation structure supporting future expansion, deployment infrastructure using Cloudflare Workers with Static Assets, and Web3-ready foundations that enable future blockchain integration without architectural changes.

While interactive Web3 features such as wallet connections, on-chain data display, and token gating are outside the initial implementation scope, the architecture must include specific preparations to enable these features in future iterations. This includes React island support, environment variable structures, and component organization patterns that facilitate Web3 integration without requiring refactoring.

---

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

#### Content Presentation

The homepage must present information through a clear hierarchical structure that guides visitors toward key actions. The hero section must immediately communicate SuperBenefit's identity as a DAO focused on social impact and Web3 governance. This primary messaging must be supported by sections explaining the organization's mission, current initiatives, and pathways for engagement.

All content must be authored in markdown files with YAML frontmatter, maintaining consistency with the team's existing workflow. The frontmatter schema must support essential metadata including title, description, tags, and publication status. While the initial implementation focuses on standard markdown, the architecture must not preclude future adoption of MDX for component embedding within content files.

#### External Content Aggregation

The system must automatically incorporate relevant content from SuperBenefit's distributed repositories during the build process. This aggregation must occur without manual intervention, fetching recent entries from the knowledge garden and governance repository via GitHub's API. The aggregation system must respect publication flags in source content, displaying only materials explicitly marked for public consumption.

Aggregated content must be presented in dedicated sections of the homepage with clear visual distinction from local content. Each aggregated item must display its title, description, publication date, and a link to the full content in its original location. The system must gracefully handle aggregation failures, using cached content when external sources are unavailable and providing clear build-time warnings without failing the entire build process.

#### Navigation and Information Architecture

The navigation system must provide intuitive pathways to all major sections of SuperBenefit's digital presence. Primary navigation must include links to the homepage, knowledge garden, governance repository, and placeholder structure for future pages such as services, about, and contribution guides. The navigation must clearly indicate when links lead to external properties versus internal pages.

Mobile navigation must be fully accessible without compromising the design aesthetic. The implementation must use established patterns familiar to web users, such as a hamburger menu for mobile viewports, while ensuring all navigation elements remain keyboard accessible. Footer navigation must provide supplementary links to social media, documentation, and community resources without duplicating the primary navigation structure.

#### Web3 Readiness Requirements

The architecture must establish foundations for future Web3 integration without implementing these features in the initial release. React framework support must be configured through Astro's integration system, enabling future deployment of Web3 components as isolated islands. This preparation adds no performance overhead when React components are not present but ensures wallet connection interfaces, on-chain data displays, and governance tools can be added without architectural changes.

Environment variable structures must be established for blockchain configuration including chain IDs, RPC endpoints, and API keys for services like The Graph, Alchemy, and IPFS gateways. These variables should follow PUBLIC_ prefix conventions for client-side exposure and remain empty in initial deployment. The configuration structure must support multiple chains and environments without requiring code changes.

Component organization must separate Web3-specific components from general interactive components through dedicated directory structures. A `src/components/web3/` directory must be created for future blockchain-related components, while `src/components/interactive/` houses standard interactive elements. This separation ensures Web3 features can be added incrementally without affecting existing functionality.

Data fetching abstractions must be established to support future integration with blockchain data sources. A provider interface pattern must be implemented that can later accommodate GraphQL queries to The Graph, direct chain queries via Alchemy or Infura, and IPFS content retrieval. The initial implementation requires only the interface definition, with concrete implementations added as needed.

State management preparation must include stores for authentication and wallet connection state using lightweight solutions like nanostores. While not utilized in the initial release, these stores establish patterns for managing user identity, wallet addresses, and token balances when Web3 features are implemented. The architecture must support both authenticated and anonymous user experiences without requiring fundamental changes.

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance Requirements

The homepage must deliver exceptional performance across all devices and network conditions. Largest Contentful Paint must occur within 2.5 seconds on simulated 3G connections. Cumulative Layout Shift must remain below 0.1 throughout the page lifecycle. Time to Interactive must not exceed 3.5 seconds on mobile devices. The total JavaScript payload must not exceed 50KB gzipped for the initial page load.

Build performance must support rapid iteration during development. Full site builds must complete within 60 seconds on standard development hardware. The production build process must generate optimized assets with appropriate caching headers for edge deployment. The system must support incremental builds during development, recompiling only changed files to maintain developer productivity.

#### Accessibility Standards

The homepage must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance across all content and interactive elements. This requirement extends beyond mere technical compliance to encompass genuine usability for users with disabilities. All images must include descriptive alt text that conveys meaning rather than merely describing visual appearance. Interactive elements must be fully navigable via keyboard with clear focus indicators that meet color contrast requirements.

The semantic HTML structure must accurately convey document hierarchy to assistive technologies. ARIA attributes must be used judiciously to enhance, not replace, semantic markup. Form inputs, when present, must include associated labels, helpful error messages, and clear instructions. The site must remain functional and comprehensible when CSS fails to load or JavaScript is disabled.

#### Browser Compatibility

The site must function correctly in all evergreen browsers, including current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. While advanced features may provide enhanced experiences in modern browsers, core content and functionality must remain accessible in browsers up to two years old. This compatibility must be achieved through progressive enhancement rather than polyfills that increase bundle size.

CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts must include appropriate fallbacks to ensure readable content presentation in older browsers. Modern JavaScript features must be transpiled to a compatibility target of ES2020, balancing file size with browser support. The site must be tested across different viewport sizes from 320px to 2560px width, ensuring responsive behavior at all sizes.

### 2.3 Constraints

#### Development Approach

Development follows a pragmatic approach prioritizing shipped functionality over perfect architecture. Implementation proceeds iteratively: first establishing a functional static site with basic content structure, then implementing the design system and content aggregation, followed by polish, testing, and deployment preparation.

#### Team Constraints

Development will be conducted by a team of 2-3 generalist developers without dedicated frontend specialists. The architecture must therefore prioritize clarity over cleverness, using established patterns and avoiding exotic dependencies. Code organization must be immediately comprehensible to developers familiar with standard JavaScript projects. Documentation must be embedded within the codebase through clear naming and code comments rather than separate documentation systems.

#### Infrastructure Constraints

The homepage must deploy to Cloudflare Workers using their Static Assets functionality. This constraint determines several architectural decisions. The build output must be static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files compatible with edge serving. The deployment process must use Wrangler CLI for consistency with existing infrastructure. The total asset size must remain within Cloudflare's free tier limits of 25MB after compression.

---

## 3. Architecture

### 3.1 Technology Stack

The homepage will be built using Astro as the primary framework, chosen for its exceptional static site generation capabilities and minimal client-side JavaScript footprint. Astro's philosophy of shipping zero JavaScript by default aligns perfectly with the performance requirements while its island architecture enables selective interactivity where needed. Version 5.1 or higher is required to access the Content Layer API for external content aggregation.

Styling will use Tailwind CSS version 3.4, providing a utility-first approach that accelerates development while maintaining consistency. Tailwind's configuration will define design tokens as CSS custom properties, enabling visual harmony with existing SuperBenefit properties without requiring shared dependencies. The JIT compiler ensures only used styles are included in the final bundle, minimizing CSS payload.

TypeScript will be used throughout the codebase with strict mode enabled, providing type safety without requiring extensive type definitions. The configuration will target ES2020 for broad compatibility while enabling modern development features. Biome will handle code formatting and linting, chosen over traditional ESLint/Prettier combinations for its 25x performance improvement and zero-configuration approach.

Web3 readiness requires specific integrations configured but not actively used in the initial release. The React integration for Astro must be installed and configured, enabling future deployment of Web3 components without architectural changes. Nanostores must be included for lightweight state management, providing a foundation for wallet and authentication state. These additions impose no performance penalty when unused but ensure the architecture can accommodate blockchain features seamlessly.

### 3.2 Content Architecture

Content organization follows a clear separation of concerns that maps mental models to filesystem structure. Local content resides in `src/content/pages/` as markdown files with YAML frontmatter. Each file represents a distinct page or section of the homepage, with frontmatter defining metadata and markdown body containing the content. This structure mirrors the team's existing workflow with the knowledge base.

External content aggregation leverages Astro's Content Layer API to fetch and process content from GitHub repositories at build time. The knowledge garden content collection fetches recent posts marked with `publish: true` from the knowledge-garden repository. The governance content collection retrieves policy documents and updates from the governance repository. Both collections define schemas that validate incoming content and provide TypeScript types for template consumption.

The build process transforms all content into static HTML during compilation, eliminating runtime content fetching. This approach ensures consistent performance regardless of external service availability. Content collections are configured with appropriate caching strategies, storing fetched content locally for development efficiency and build resilience.

### 3.3 Component Architecture

The component system employs Astro's island architecture to deliver optimal performance with selective interactivity. Most homepage content renders as static HTML with zero client-side JavaScript. Interactive elements such as mobile navigation, theme toggles, and content filters are implemented as islands that hydrate only when needed. This approach ensures the homepage remains functional even when JavaScript fails to load.

Components are organized by function and framework to support both current needs and future Web3 integration. The `src/components/layout/` directory contains structural components like headers, footers, and navigation. The `src/components/content/` directory houses components for displaying various content types. The `src/components/interactive/` directory isolates standard components requiring client-side JavaScript. The `src/components/web3/` directory is established for future blockchain-related components, maintaining clear separation between Web3 and traditional functionality.

The architecture supports multiple component frameworks through Astro's integration system. While initial components use Astro's native format for optimal performance, React components can be seamlessly integrated for Web3 functionality. This multi-framework approach ensures the right tool for each use case without forcing framework uniformity. Web3 components will load only when explicitly needed, preventing blockchain libraries from affecting initial page performance.

Styling follows a component-scoped approach using Tailwind classes within Astro components. Global styles are minimal, limited to CSS custom properties for design tokens and base typography settings. This approach prevents style conflicts while maintaining the flexibility to adjust visual design without restructuring components. Web3 components will inherit the same design tokens, ensuring visual consistency regardless of framework.

### 3.4 Build and Deployment Architecture

The build pipeline transforms source files into optimized static assets suitable for edge deployment. Astro's build process handles markdown processing, content aggregation, and HTML generation. Assets undergo optimization including image compression, CSS purging, and JavaScript minification. The output structure maps directly to URL paths, simplifying deployment and debugging.

Deployment uses Cloudflare Workers with Static Assets, leveraging Wrangler for consistent deployment workflows. The worker script serves static assets with appropriate cache headers while reserving the ability to add edge functions in the future. This architecture provides the simplicity of static hosting with the flexibility of edge computing when needed.

The development workflow emphasizes rapid iteration through hot module replacement and incremental builds. The development server proxies external content requests to avoid rate limiting during active development. Environment variables separate development, staging, and production configurations without requiring code changes.

### 3.5 Web3 Integration Foundations

The architecture establishes specific foundations for future blockchain integration without implementing Web3 features in the initial release. These preparations ensure that wallet connections, on-chain data display, and governance tools can be added progressively without architectural refactoring.

Data provider abstractions define interfaces for future blockchain data sources. The base DataProvider interface establishes a contract for data fetching that can be implemented by GraphQL clients for The Graph, JSON-RPC providers for direct chain access, and IPFS gateways for decentralized content. Initial implementation includes only the interface definitions in `src/lib/providers/`, with concrete implementations added as features require.

Environment configuration structure supports blockchain integration through a comprehensive variable schema. Variables for chain IDs, RPC endpoints, subgraph URLs, and API keys are defined but left empty. The PUBLIC_ prefix convention identifies client-safe variables, while server-only credentials use standard naming. This structure supports multi-chain deployments and network switching without code modifications. The initial `.env.example` file establishes the schema:

```
# Web3 Configuration (empty initially, structure ready for future use)
PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=1
PUBLIC_RPC_URL=
PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=
PUBLIC_SUBGRAPH_URL=
PUBLIC_IPFS_GATEWAY=https://ipfs.io/ipfs/
PUBLIC_ARAGON_DAO_ADDRESS=
PUBLIC_HATS_TREE_ID=

# Server-only (for future edge functions)
ALCHEMY_API_KEY=
INFURA_API_KEY=
```

State management architecture uses nanostores to prepare for user authentication and wallet state. The `src/stores/` directory contains store definitions for user identity, wallet connection status, and network state. While unused initially, these stores establish patterns for managing Web3 state that integrate naturally with Astro's island architecture. The stores are designed to work with multiple wallet providers and support both connected and disconnected user experiences.

Edge function preparation ensures token gating and authentication can be added to Cloudflare Workers. The deployment structure includes placeholder middleware that can verify token ownership, validate signatures, and manage session state using Cloudflare KV storage. Route-specific authentication can be implemented by adding checks to the worker router without modifying the static site generation process.

## 4. Design System

### 4.1 Visual Consistency Strategy

Visual harmony with existing SuperBenefit properties will be achieved through parallel implementation of shared design principles rather than literal sharing of stylesheets. This approach acknowledges the technical incompatibility between Quartz's Lightning CSS and Tailwind while achieving the desired visual consistency. Design tokens defined as CSS custom properties provide the bridge between different technical implementations.

The color system mirrors the knowledge garden's palette with semantic naming that maps colors to their functional purpose. Primary colors use the green spectrum established in the knowledge garden, with `--color-primary: #2a521e` in light mode and `--color-primary: rgb(177, 132, 55)` in dark mode. Neutral colors provide consistent grayscale values across all properties. Accent colors highlight interactive elements and important information.

Typography establishes clear hierarchy through consistent font families and sizing scales. Headings use Schibsted Grotesk, matching the knowledge garden's display font. Body text uses Source Sans Pro for optimal readability across devices. Code blocks use IBM Plex Mono, maintaining consistency with technical documentation. The type scale follows a major third ratio, providing clear visual hierarchy without excessive variation.

### 4.2 Responsive Design Framework

The responsive strategy employs a mobile-first approach with breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px. These breakpoints align with common device sizes while providing flexibility for intermediate viewports. Layout shifts are minimized through consistent spacing and careful management of dynamic content areas.

The grid system uses CSS Grid for major layout structures with Flexbox for component-level arrangements. This combination provides powerful layout capabilities while maintaining compatibility with older browsers through appropriate fallbacks. Container queries are avoided in the initial implementation to ensure broad compatibility, with max-width containers providing responsive behavior.

Touch targets maintain a minimum size of 44x44 pixels to ensure usability on mobile devices. Interactive elements include appropriate hover states for desktop users and focus states for keyboard navigation. Animations respect prefers-reduced-motion preferences, ensuring the site remains accessible to users with vestibular disorders.

### 4.3 Dark Mode Implementation

Dark mode support responds to system preferences by default with an optional manual toggle for user preference. The implementation uses CSS custom properties to define color values that automatically adjust based on the active theme. This approach avoids duplicate CSS rules while ensuring all components respect the user's theme preference.

The color adjustments for dark mode go beyond simple inversion, carefully tuning contrast ratios and color relationships for optimal readability in low-light conditions. Background colors shift to near-black rather than pure black to reduce eye strain. Text colors adjust to slightly reduced brightness to avoid harsh contrast. Accent colors are modified to maintain visibility without becoming garish.

## 5. Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

The first week establishes the technical foundation and basic content structure. Development begins with project initialization using Astro's create-astro CLI with TypeScript template. The initial commit includes configuration for Tailwind CSS, Biome for code quality, and Wrangler for deployment. React integration is configured but not actively used, ensuring Web3 components can be added later without architectural changes. This foundation phase prioritizes getting a deployable "Hello World" to production within the first two days.

Content structure implementation follows immediately after initial setup. Basic markdown pages are created for homepage sections including hero, mission, and initiatives. The frontmatter schema is defined with TypeScript interfaces ensuring consistency across all content. Navigation components are implemented with mobile-responsive behavior, establishing patterns for future expansion.

Web3 foundations are established without implementing blockchain features. Directory structures are created for future Web3 components (`src/components/web3/`). Environment variable schemas are defined for blockchain configuration with empty defaults. Data provider interfaces are established in `src/lib/providers/` for future integration with The Graph and chain data. State management stores are initialized using nanostores for future wallet and authentication state. These preparations add no overhead to the initial site but ensure seamless Web3 integration later.

By week's end, a functional but unstyled homepage deploys to Cloudflare Workers. This deployment validates the build pipeline, deployment process, and hosting configuration. The site may lack visual polish but demonstrates all technical integrations functioning correctly, including verification that unused Web3 preparations do not impact performance.

### 5.2 Phase 2: Content and Styling (Week 2)

The second week focuses on visual design implementation and external content aggregation. The design system is implemented through Tailwind configuration and CSS custom properties. Colors, typography, and spacing from existing SuperBenefit properties are translated into the new system. Components are styled to match the established visual language while optimizing for performance.

Content aggregation is configured using Astro's Content Layer API. GitHub loaders are implemented for both knowledge garden and governance repositories. Schema definitions validate incoming content and filter based on publication status. The homepage is updated to display aggregated content in dedicated sections with appropriate visual treatment.

Progressive enhancement adds selective interactivity where it improves user experience. The mobile navigation menu is enhanced with smooth animations. Theme toggle functionality is added for dark mode preference. These enhancements are implemented as Astro islands, ensuring they don't impact initial page load performance.

### 5.3 Phase 3: Polish and Deployment (Week 3)

The final week emphasizes quality assurance and production preparation. Performance optimization ensures all Lighthouse metrics meet or exceed requirements. Images are optimized and converted to modern formats. Critical CSS is inlined while non-critical styles are deferred. JavaScript bundles are analyzed and optimized to remain under size budgets.

Accessibility testing validates WCAG compliance across all components and content. Keyboard navigation is verified for all interactive elements. Screen reader compatibility is tested using NVDA and JAWS. Color contrast ratios are validated using automated tools and manual inspection. Any identified issues are resolved before production deployment.

The production deployment process is documented and tested. Environment variables are configured for production settings. Caching headers are optimized for edge serving. Monitoring is configured to track performance and errors. The final deployment to Cloudflare Workers marks the successful completion of the initial homepage implementation.

---

## 6. Validation and Acceptance

### 6.1 Acceptance Criteria

The homepage meets acceptance criteria when all functional requirements are implemented and verified. Content displays correctly across all specified viewport sizes. External content aggregation successfully fetches and displays recent entries. Navigation provides access to all defined sections and external properties. The visual design achieves consistency with existing SuperBenefit properties.

Performance metrics must meet or exceed specified thresholds in production environment testing. Lighthouse scores achieve 95 or higher for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. Page weight remains under 250KB for initial HTML, CSS, and JavaScript combined. Time to Interactive stays below 3.5 seconds on simulated 3G connections.

Accessibility compliance is verified through both automated and manual testing. Axe DevTools reports no critical violations. Keyboard navigation functions correctly for all interactive elements. Screen reader testing confirms content is properly announced and navigable. Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards throughout the site.

### 6.2 Testing Requirements

Testing follows a pragmatic approach appropriate for the project timeline and team size. Unit tests are not required for the initial implementation, prioritizing shipped functionality over test coverage. However, the architecture must not preclude adding tests in future iterations. Critical user paths are validated through manual testing before deployment.

Build process validation ensures content aggregation handles various failure scenarios. External repository unavailability must not break the build process. Malformed content must be logged and skipped rather than causing build failures. Cache functionality must be verified to prevent unnecessary API calls during development.

Cross-browser testing validates functionality in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. While automated testing tools are not required, manual verification must confirm core functionality in each browser. Mobile device testing uses browser DevTools emulation supplemented by testing on actual devices when available.

### 6.3 Performance Benchmarks

Specific performance benchmarks define success beyond pass/fail metrics. The homepage must achieve Time to First Byte under 200ms from Cloudflare edge locations. First Contentful Paint must occur within 1.5 seconds on 4G connections. The Speed Index must remain below 3.0 seconds across all test scenarios.

Resource optimization benchmarks ensure efficient delivery. HTML documents must be under 50KB after compression. CSS stylesheets must not exceed 75KB after purging unused styles. JavaScript bundles must remain under 50KB gzipped for the initial page load. Images must be optimized to appropriate formats with responsive sizing.

Build performance benchmarks support developer productivity. Development builds must complete within 5 seconds for single file changes. Production builds must finish within 60 seconds on GitHub Actions runners. Content aggregation must cache results for 1 hour during development to prevent API rate limiting.

---

## 7. Future Considerations

### 7.1 Expansion Pathways

The architecture explicitly supports several expansion pathways without requiring fundamental changes. Additional static pages can be added by creating new markdown files in the content directory. The navigation structure accommodates new sections through configuration updates. The component system allows gradual enhancement with interactive features as needed.

Web3 functionality can be progressively added through the established foundations. Phase one Web3 features include read-only blockchain data display using The Graph subgraphs cached at build time. Components in `src/components/web3/` can fetch and display on-chain data without requiring user wallet connections. Phase two adds wallet connectivity through RainbowKit or Web3Modal, implemented as React islands that load on demand. Sign-in with Ethereum can provide authentication using edge functions in Cloudflare Workers.

Advanced Web3 integration follows established patterns without architectural changes. Hats Protocol visualization can display role hierarchies and permissions as static data with optional interactive filtering. Aragon SDK integration enables governance participation interfaces, loading only when users explicitly engage with governance features. Token gating leverages edge functions to verify ownership before serving protected content. Each feature exists as an isolated island, ensuring Web3 functionality never compromises site performance for users without Web3 requirements.

Content management capabilities can evolve from the current file-based system. A headless CMS could be integrated through the Content Layer API without changing the site architecture. Editorial workflows could be added through GitHub Actions and pull request automation. These enhancements can be implemented based on actual team needs rather than speculative requirements.

### 7.2 Migration Strategies

The specification acknowledges that technology choices may need revision as requirements evolve. The markdown-based content strategy ensures content portability regardless of framework changes. Frontmatter schemas use standard YAML without framework-specific extensions. This approach ensures content can be migrated to any static site generator if needed.

Component architecture maintains clear boundaries that facilitate framework migration. Business logic is separated from presentation through clear interfaces. Styling uses utility classes that can be mechanically transformed if moving away from Tailwind. Interactive components are isolated, allowing piecewise migration if switching frameworks.

The deployment architecture remains platform-agnostic despite using Cloudflare Workers. Build outputs are standard static files deployable to any CDN or hosting service. Environment-specific configurations are isolated in deployment manifests. This flexibility ensures the organization isn't locked into specific infrastructure providers.

---

## 8. Conclusion

This specification defines a pragmatic approach to implementing SuperBenefit DAO's homepage that balances immediate needs with future flexibility. The chosen architecture prioritizes shipping functional software within aggressive timelines while establishing patterns for iterative improvement. By leveraging modern tools like Astro and Tailwind CSS while maintaining simple, understandable structures, the implementation remains accessible to the existing development team.

The focus on static generation with selective enhancement ensures exceptional performance without sacrificing functionality. The content aggregation strategy maintains the organization's distributed content model while providing a unified entry point for visitors. The visual design approach achieves consistency with existing properties through parallel implementation of shared principles rather than forcing technical uniformity.

Critical to the long-term success is the Web3-ready foundation that enables progressive enhancement without architectural debt. By establishing proper abstractions, component structures, and deployment patterns from the outset, the homepage can evolve to include wallet connections, on-chain data, and governance interfaces as needs emerge. This preparation requires minimal initial effort but prevents costly refactoring when Web3 features become priorities.

Success will be measured not by architectural perfection but by delivering a professional, performant homepage that serves SuperBenefit DAO's immediate needs while providing a foundation for growth. The specification provides sufficient detail to guide implementation while maintaining flexibility for the development team to make pragmatic decisions during the build process. This balance of prescription and flexibility reflects the reality of small team development where shipped software trumps perfect architecture.
